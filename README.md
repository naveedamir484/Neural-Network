# Neural-Network

Deep Neural Network for classifying images as cat v/s non-cat.
Build and train a deep N-layer neural network, and apply it to supervised learning after performing sample test cases and then bring the model down to optimal accuracy after performing number of iteration & then predicted the results with Accuracy (72%).
Tech. Stack - Numpy, Matplotlib, Jupiter NoteBook, Pillow, Python3, etc.
